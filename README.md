# March-Madness-Data
Will gather data about teams in the March Madness tournament.
1. Find list of teams in tournament and put into database
2. Gather data for each team (ESPN, CBS, ???)
3. Put all into one database

## Improvements
* Find better site for list of teams in each tournament (i.e. more consistent YoY)
* Find better site for data (i.e. not rely on getting codes for each team with ESPN)
